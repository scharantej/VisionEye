<h2>Blind Runners in Israel</h2>
<p>
The Eye-Contact Association is proud to support blind runners in Israel. We believe that everyone, regardless of their vision, should have the opportunity to participate in sports and fitness activities.
</p>
<p>
We offer a variety of programs and services to support blind runners, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Running clinics</li>
<li>Training programs</li>
<li>Race day support</li>
<li>Equipment and gear</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also work to raise awareness about blind runners and to advocate for their rights. We believe that blind runners should have the same opportunities to participate in sports and fitness activities as sighted runners.
</p>
