<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
The Eye-Contact Association is a non-profit organization that provides support and resources to blind and visually impaired people in Israel. We are dedicated to empowering our members to live full and independent lives.

We were founded in 1992 by a group of blind and visually impaired Israelis. We have since grown to become one of the leading organizations in Israel that provides services to blind and visually impaired people.

Our mission is to provide blind and visually impaired people in Israel with the tools and resources they need to live full and independent lives. We believe that everyone, regardless of their vision, deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential.
